# chatGPTconverterExt
Extension to copy Questions and context from https://www.mcempirics.com/.
The context, including images, will be copied and formatted so you can paste it
in ChatGPT and get a short answer which should be right. 

Fixed needed since they changed their site:
- Multi img support for context because of muliple lates images / or get alt text from images
- Multi table support in context
- Answers in context support
- Support for false/ true questions (no idea what broke it)

Extension is not usable atm and won't be fixed since i have no MC empirics tests left to test
